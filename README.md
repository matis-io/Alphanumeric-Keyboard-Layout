# Simplify Spelling with an Alphanumeric Keyboard Layout

I've made this picture to make spelling out booking codes and names easy. I figured I'd put it out there for everyone. Hopefully this'll make your life a bit easier too!

It's weird, but all the other pictures I found online just had letters in columns or rows. Made it a real pain to find the right letter quickly. Drove me nuts!
