# Simplify Spelling with an Alphanumeric Keyboard Layout

Have you ever found yourself on a phone call, struggling to spell out your last name or a booking code? If you're like me and don't know the alphanumeric alphabet by heart, you probably end up searching for it online. I used to find these charts frustrating. They often come in sheets or columns, and I would struggle to locate the right letter. By the time I found it, I had already forgotten where I was in the word! This frustration led me to create a keyboard layout with the alphanumeric alphabet overlay. With this layout, my eyes glide to the right letter immediately, making spelling out words incredibly efficient and fast. I hope it does the same for you!
